To-do list and new proposals:
 - The map, the bar and the ball could be local variables.
 - The bar should be generated always in the middle of the screen between matches.
 - The ball could be thrown with different angles.
 - The buttons could have arrows.
 - There must be a life-score in the screen.
 - Same, but with the remaining destructible blocks.
 - Generate quality doxygen docs for each function.
 - Extract bar and ball speeds to a game constant.
 - Modularize even more the game.
 - Check styles.
 - Delete useless comments, and check for more unused variables.
